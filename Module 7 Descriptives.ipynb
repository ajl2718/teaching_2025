We also learned how to visualise simple relationships between different types of variables, and run simple analyses to test for differences across groups. \n\nNow we're going to apply the techniques learned in this module to data from the MIMIC II clinical database, focusing on the authentic failed extubation example we initiated with the digital phenotypes last week. \n\n## Extubation status question\nAs you will have just discussed, the goal of these few weeks is to see if we can predict extubation status. In this Descriptives class, we will do some preliminary analyses to see if any of our variables appear to relate to extubation status, and we will get to know our sample. \n\n### Learning objectives\nBy the end of this class, you will be able to:\n1. Be able to summarise and visualise variables by variable type; that is:\n2. Review and summarise categorical variables to describe your sample\n3. Summarise numeric variables according to distribution\n4. Compare numeric variables by group/categorical variable\n5. Interpret scatterplots and know when they are useful\n\n### Pre-class activities\nThis class is written with the assumption that **you have already**: \n- **Completed the reading and exercises** on variable types (categorical, Boolean, continuous etc). \n- **Familiarised yourself with the MIMIC II data** and the data dictionary for the table we will use today (ext_data).\n- **Familiarised yourself with Jupyter notebooks**\n\n### Activities\nThere are five activities in this notebook, which you will complete during the classes:\n* Activity 1 Visualise categorical variables\n* Activity 2 Summarise categorical variables\n* Activity 3 Summarise numeric variables\n* Demo Introducing Scatterplots\n\n### How to use this notebook\n\nGo the 'Run' menu, then scroll down to 'Run all cells' and click this - this will run all cells! \n\nIf you want to re-run any cell, click in the cell, and then click `Ctrl + Enter` to run the cell.\n\nYou will occasionally be asked to modify some small bits of text within the code, and select variables from some drop-down widgets to automatically re-run some code. You do not need to know how to code in order to do this successfully.\n\nYou are not expected to understand the Python code, or to be able to write Python code. It is made available for students who are interested. \n","metadata":{},"attachments":{}},{"id":"e5b9f338-e5fa-4da7-8a5d-5326ffd39a99","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introducing the MIMIC II data base and the extracted data set\n\nWe are using a smaller data set (called **ext_data.csv**), extracted from MIMIC 2. \n\n**Each row** in the data set **comprises**: \n\n- **One patient**, starting with their unique `subject_id`\n  \n- A unique `icustay_id` (if a patient attended the ICU more than once, they will have more than one row in the data - one row per unique `icustay_id`)\n  \n- Demographic data and `admission_type_descr` (elective, emergency or urgent admission)\n- Comorbidities, clinical observations and some intubation details\n  \nYou should be familiar with these variables from the data dictionary: `Data dictionary ext_data`","metadata":{}},{"id":"e0dea496-de62-4233-b6d3-88311c342edd","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Configure notebook and import Python packages\nThis section installs and imports the relevant Python packages and configures the notebook.","metadata":{}},{"id":"3f28dda5-4e0f-4978-822c-cc6c97447e0f","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now these libraries are installed, import them into this session by running the cell below.","metadata":{}},{"id":"ec5b02e3-94b9-4236-9b43-b82c207ad24b","cell_type":"code","source":"# Import your utilities and all necessary modules\nfrom d2k_utils_mod8 import *\nfrom ipywidgets import interact, widgets\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom scipy.stats import fisher_exact  \n\n# Set pandas display options\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\npd.set_option('display.width', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\nsns.set()\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"3dce01f5-2df6-4135-ba19-461254e1a5ba","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Show the variables for the first few patients","metadata":{}},{"id":"19b832d2-3a34-4f15-8292-07b7a1dba5b4","cell_type":"code","source":"# Import the data\ndf = load_data(\"ext_data.csv\")\n\n# Print the first five rows\ndf.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"264efafe-9ac2-4fee-a063-b8be31fd9a73","cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Activity 1: Visualise categorical variables\nUsing the table above, which variables would you need to be able to describe the patients in your sample?","metadata":{}},{"id":"bd086b4c-42fa-4f9e-b5bd-3656cbbffb09","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.1 Visualise categorical variables using bar charts\n\nOther than age, the variables to describe your sample are categorical. \n\nTo visualise categorical variables, produce bar charts.","metadata":{}},{"id":"05de6954-9906-4a9d-addb-f1da623e24ab","cell_type":"code","source":"# Categorical variables\ncategorical_variables = ['sex', 'marital_status_descr', 'ethnicity_descr', 'admission_type_descr', 'congestive_heart_failure', 'chronic_pulmonary']\n\n# Create bar charts\nfor var in categorical_variables:\n    create_bar_chart(var)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"c75bd4cd-6fcc-4a91-bae3-9f33e6444b7e","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2 Combine small categories, and recreate bar charts\n\nYou will see many categories are very small.
